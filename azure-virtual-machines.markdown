#Introduction

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is a cloud computing platform offered by Google containing many services spanning infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), platform-as-a-service (PaaS) and software-as-a-service (SaaS). This enabled workloads of varying complexity to run on GCP, from static websites to sophisticated applications using managed databases and serverless technology.

In this tutorial, you will execute the steps required to create a Linux Virtual Machine (VM) in GCP using the Google Cloud Console. You will then log in to that VM, install the Nginx web server and expose the VM to the internet.
